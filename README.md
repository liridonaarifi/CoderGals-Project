Deciding to work on a WordPress plugin was a challenge for me, as it was something I had never worked on before. However, that's what HACKATHON is to do something new, and I think at the end together with
the group we achieved the goal.

 We first started creating an empty WP plugin and later installed the JS-Communicator in it.</p>
              
 JSCommunicator is a WebRTC communication tool developed in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It supports voice, video and chats messaging using the SIP protocol over WebSockets.

 We did add a little colours to the design of the JS communicator and make it look more beautiful!</p>
In the end we could make calls and video calls from Wordpress to other platforms.</p>
